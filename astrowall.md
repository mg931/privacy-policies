## Astro Wall: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Astro Wall app for Android. 
This is closed source Android app which is available on the Google Play store. 

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by you (the user) is stored on your device only. All data can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it, with the exception of astronomy images you choose to download to the device's 'download' folder, which are retained after the app is uninstalled.
